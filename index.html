                Mario, and Batman Arkham games(arkham asylum, arkham city, and arkham knight). I have two cats, "Little
                Kitty" and "Jeffery", I love them dearly. I live in Brigham City near walmart and a mile away from Box
                Elder High School. I also work at Maverik gas station, its an ok job but not the best. I am currently
                learning how to drive so I can drive to work and school. I live with my mom in Brigham city, I do not go
                to my dads house in perry.</p>

            <p>I am a senior at Box Elder High school. At Box Elder, I took all of their coding classes and took the
                HTML and CSS class twice. I also go to bridgerland through Box Elders Program. I've taken Business
                technology, IT, and currently taking Web &amp; Mobile Development. In the Business technology class, I
                took two courses: Entrepreneurship and an Adobe class. In IT I took a linux course that talked all about
                how linux works and how to use a Command Line interface instead of a Ghrapical user interface. I have
                also taken a summer course in HTML with Code to Success. In that class I made a simple website. </p>

            <p>I have had only 1 job in my life, I work at Maverik. Maverik is just a gas station, I work in the food
                section of the gas station. I do not have any work experince in coding nor anything else except food
                related. Finding jobs that include coding as a seventeen year old is difficult. As with my current job,
                I work at the maverik in brigham city(technically it's in perry) right next to dary queen. I have worked
                their for almost two years (1 year and 10 months). Its an ok job but not the best becuase it can
                sometimes be difficult for me to get off on time. </p>
